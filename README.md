# KMeans-Python

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Means attempts to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.
The real world applications of K-Means include:


    - customer profiling
    - market segmentation
    - computer vision
    - search engines
    - astronomy
